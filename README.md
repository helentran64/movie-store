The Online Movie Store DBMS provides a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate movie purchases to cater to the increasing demand for digital entertainment. The system offers users the convenience of accessing various movies from the comfort of their homes, and they can start watching the film upon purchase. Furthermore, the system provides the users with the option to add movies to their watchlist and rate movies they’ve seen. 

Once a user creates an account, it will store their name, username, email, and password as attributes in the “user” table. When logging in, the username and password entered will be validated. The system will retrieve data from the “movie” table such as movie ID, title, director, duration, genre, release date, and description, to display information of the movies for the users to browse from. In addition, movies can be searched by genre, release date, and director. If a user decides to purchase a movie to stream online, their username, movie ID, transaction ID, date, time, and total amount will be stored in the “transaction” table. When users rate a movie, the system will insert the movie ID, username, and rating to the “rating” table to gather feedback. Lastly, once the user adds movies to their watchlist, it will record data about the movie ID, username, and date added to keep track of movies that they might be interested in watching in the future.
